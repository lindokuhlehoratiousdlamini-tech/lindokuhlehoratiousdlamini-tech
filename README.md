## Hi there I`m Lindokuhle Dlamini 👋
I’m passionate about blending technology, teaching, and graphic design to create engaging learning experiences. I love digging into new tools, turning complex ideas into clear visuals, and sharing that knowledge with others. Whether it’s coding interactive tutorials, designing eye catching educational graphics, or mentoring peers, I thrive on making learning both fun and accessible. This drive fuels everything I put on GitHub, from open‑source lesson packs to visually rich project demos.

I am deeply passionate about cloud computing because I believe it is more than just the future,it's the engine of modern innovation. I'm fascinated by its potential to empower businesses of all sizes, offering unprecedented scalability, flexibility, and security. My ultimate goal as a Solutions Architect is to be at the forefront of this transformation, leveraging my skills to design elegant, impactful solutions that harness the full power of the cloud. This passion is the driving force behind my continuous learning and my commitment to helping businesses not just adapt, but thrive in the digital age.

# 😁 About Me
## **Background**

I am coming from a non-technical background, I once thought tech was too complex to be a space I could thrive in until I joined a Robotics club back in high school. That experience planted the first seed of my interest in technology. Since then, I’ve reignited that spark by joining AWS re/Start, a life changing opportunity that has helped me build foundational cloud computing knowledge and hands-on experience in areas like Linux, AWS services, security, networking, and more. I've learned to deploy static websites on S3, work with databases, and understand how cloud infrastructure supports real-world applications.

## AWS re/Start Journey
Recently, I completed the intensive AWS re/Start program, where I built a robust foundation in cloud technologies. Beyond the practical projects showcased here, the program provided me with:
- Comprehensive theoretical knowledge of core AWS services and their interconnections.
- A deep understanding of cloud best practices in areas like security, cost optimization, and operational excellence.
- Essential problem-solving methodologies tailored for cloud environments.
- Crucial professional skills, including teamwork, presentation, and effective technical communication.

This holistic experience has equipped me with both the technical acumen and the client-centric approach vital for a successful career in cloud solutions. I am now focused on securing an entry-level cloud position where I can continue to learn, grow, and gain real-world experience, building a solid technical foundation to progress into a Cloud Solutions Architect role.

## 🔧 Currently Working On
I’m currently diving into projects that fuse technology with creative teaching, like developing interactive graphic tutorials and designing visual learning kits that simplify complex ideas. I’m experimenting with tools such as Figma for design, alongside coding basics in HTML/CSS and JavaScript to build small educational web apps. My focus is on creating open-source resources that fellow students and teachers can freely use and contribute to, while I keep refining my skills in both design and tech.

## 📂 Projects

A showcase of the hands on projects I am currently completing during the intensive AWS re/Start program. Through these practical exercises, I've built a strong foundation in cloud computing and gained valuable experience in designing, deploying, and managing solutions on Amazon Web Services.

**Project 1: S3 Static Website Hosting**

This project focuses on rebuilding and migrating the Zoe Fitness website from traditional hosting to AWS Cloud. It demonstrates how a static website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can be hosted on AWS S3 and accelerated with CloudFront, secured with SSL, and optimized for global performance using services within the AWS Free Tier.
