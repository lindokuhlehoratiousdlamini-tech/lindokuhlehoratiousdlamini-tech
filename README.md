## Hi there I`m Lindokuhle Dlamini 👋
I’m passionate about blending technology, teaching, and graphic design to create engaging learning experiences. I love digging into new tools, turning complex ideas into clear visuals, and sharing that knowledge with others. Whether it’s coding interactive tutorials, designing eye catching educational graphics, or mentoring peers, I thrive on making learning both fun and accessible. This drive fuels everything I put on GitHub, from open‑source lesson packs to visually rich project demos.

## 🔧 Currently Working On
I’m currently diving into projects that fuse technology with creative teaching, like developing interactive graphic tutorials and designing visual learning kits that simplify complex ideas. I’m experimenting with tools such as Figma for design, alongside coding basics in HTML/CSS and JavaScript to build small educational web apps. My focus is on creating open-source resources that fellow students and teachers can freely use and contribute to, while I keep refining my skills in both design and tech.
