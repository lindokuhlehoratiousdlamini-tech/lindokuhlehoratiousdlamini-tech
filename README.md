## Hi there I`m Lindokuhle Dlamini 👋
I’m passionate about blending technology, teaching, and graphic design to create engaging learning experiences. I love digging into new tools, turning complex ideas into clear visuals, and sharing that knowledge with others. Whether it’s coding interactive tutorials, designing eye catching educational graphics, or mentoring peers, I thrive on making learning both fun and accessible. This drive fuels everything I put on GitHub, from open‑source lesson packs to visually rich project demos.

## 😁 About Me
**Background**

I am coming from a non-technical background, I once thought tech was too complex to be a space I could thrive in until I joined a Robotics club back in high school. That experience planted the first seed of my interest in technology. Since then, I’ve reignited that spark by joining AWS re/Start, a life-changing opportunity that has helped me build foundational cloud computing knowledge and hands-on experience in areas like Linux, AWS services, security, networking, and more. I've learned to deploy static websites on S3, work with databases, and understand how cloud infrastructure supports real-world applications.

## 🔧 Currently Working On
I’m currently diving into projects that fuse technology with creative teaching, like developing interactive graphic tutorials and designing visual learning kits that simplify complex ideas. I’m experimenting with tools such as Figma for design, alongside coding basics in HTML/CSS and JavaScript to build small educational web apps. My focus is on creating open-source resources that fellow students and teachers can freely use and contribute to, while I keep refining my skills in both design and tech.

## 📂 Projects

A showcase of the hands on projects I am currently completing during the intensive AWS re/Start program. Through these practical exercises, I've built a strong foundation in cloud computing and gained valuable experience in designing, deploying, and managing solutions on Amazon Web Services.

**Project 1: S3 Static Website Hosting**

This project focuses on rebuilding and migrating the Zoe Fitness website from traditional hosting to AWS Cloud. It demonstrates how a static website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can be hosted on AWS S3 and accelerated with CloudFront, secured with SSL, and optimized for global performance using services within the AWS Free Tier.
