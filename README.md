## Hi there I`m Lindokuhle Dlamini 👋
I’m passionate about blending technology, teaching, and graphic design to create engaging learning experiences. I love digging into new tools, turning complex ideas into clear visuals, and sharing that knowledge with others. Whether it’s coding interactive tutorials, designing eye catching educational graphics, or mentoring peers, I thrive on making learning both fun and accessible. This drive fuels everything I put on GitHub, from open‑source lesson packs to visually rich project demos.

I am deeply passionate about cloud computing because I believe it is more than just the future,it's the engine of modern innovation. I'm fascinated by its potential to empower businesses of all sizes, offering unprecedented scalability, flexibility, and security. My ultimate goal as a Solutions Architect is to be at the forefront of this transformation, leveraging my skills to design elegant, impactful solutions that harness the full power of the cloud. This passion is the driving force behind my continuous learning and my commitment to helping businesses not just adapt, but thrive in the digital age.

# 😁 About Me
## **Background**

I am coming from a non-technical background, I once thought tech was too complex to be a space I could thrive in until I joined a Robotics club back in high school. That experience planted the first seed of my interest in technology. Since then, I’ve reignited that spark by joining AWS re/Start, a life changing opportunity that has helped me build foundational cloud computing knowledge and hands-on experience in areas like Linux, AWS services, security, networking, and more. I've learned to deploy static websites on S3, work with databases, and understand how cloud infrastructure supports real-world applications.

## ⋆.˚☁️⋆AWS re/Start Journey
Recently, I completed the intensive AWS re/Start program, where I built a robust foundation in cloud technologies. Beyond the practical projects showcased here, the program provided me with:
- Comprehensive theoretical knowledge of core AWS services and their interconnections.
- A deep understanding of cloud best practices in areas like security, cost optimization, and operational excellence.
- Essential problem-solving methodologies tailored for cloud environments.
- Crucial professional skills, including teamwork, presentation, and effective technical communication.

This holistic experience has equipped me with both the technical acumen and the client-centric approach vital for a successful career in cloud solutions. I am now focused on securing an entry-level cloud position where I can continue to learn, grow, and gain real-world experience, building a solid technical foundation to progress into a Cloud Solutions Architect role.

## 💻 Hard Skills & Technologies
- **Deploying an Amazon S3 Bucket** - I created and configured S3 buckets for secure file storage and static website hosting. Through this, I learned how to manage permissions, apply bucket policies, enable public access safely, and organize data in the cloud.
- **Building Cloud Architecture on AWS** - I designed basic cloud architectures using EC2, VPC, subnets, security groups, and IAM. This helped me understand how different AWS services connect, how traffic flows through a network, and how to build scalable and secure environments.
- **Implementing Monitoring with CloudWatch** - I used CloudWatch to monitor resources, review logs, and track performance metrics, gaining experience in identifying issues and maintaining system health.
- **Configuring Identity and Access Management (IAM)** - I created users, roles, and policies to control access to AWS resources, learning the importance of least-privilege security and proper account management.
- **Developing an Amazon Lex Chatbot** - I built a basic chatbot using Amazon Lex, where I learned how to create intents, slots, and responses. This project improved my understanding of conversational AI and how cloud services can be integrated into applications.
- **Linux System Administration** - I worked in Linux environments using Bash to manage files, permissions, install packages, and troubleshoot systems, strengthening my command-line skills.
- **Networking Configuration** - I applied subnetting, CIDR, security groups, and NACLs to configure cloud networks and improve my understanding of secure communication between services.
