## Hi there I`m Lindokuhle Dlamini 👋
I’m passionate about blending technology, teaching, and graphic design to create engaging learning experiences. I love digging into new tools, turning complex ideas into clear visuals, and sharing that knowledge with others. Whether it’s coding interactive tutorials, designing eye catching educational graphics, or mentoring peers, I thrive on making learning both fun and accessible. This drive fuels everything I put on GitHub, from open‑source lesson packs to visually rich project demos.


# 😁 About Me
## **Background**

I am coming from a non-technical background, I once thought tech was too complex to be a space I could thrive in until I joined a Robotics club back in high school. That experience planted the first seed of my interest in technology. Since then, I’ve reignited that spark by joining AWS re/Start, a life changing opportunity that has helped me build foundational cloud computing knowledge and hands-on experience in areas like Linux, AWS services, security, networking, and more. I've learned to deploy static websites on S3, work with databases, and understand how cloud infrastructure supports real-world applications.

## ⋆.˚☁️⋆ AWS re/Start Journey
Recently, I completed the intensive AWS re/Start program, where I built a robust foundation in cloud technologies. Beyond the practical projects showcased here, the program provided me with:
- Comprehensive theoretical knowledge of core AWS services and their interconnections.
- A deep understanding of cloud best practices in areas like security, cost optimization, and operational excellence.
- Essential problem-solving methodologies tailored for cloud environments.
- Crucial professional skills, including teamwork, presentation, and effective technical communication.

This holistic experience has equipped me with both the technical acumen and the client-centric approach vital for a successful career in cloud solutions. I am now focused on securing an entry-level cloud position where I can continue to learn, grow, and gain real-world experience, building a solid technical foundation to progress into a Cloud Solutions Architect role.
